# Space Salary

## Description deliverable

### Elevator pitch
Have you ever felt cramped? Ever felt like you needed more space? Well now you can, with our new and improved game, Space Salary. This nifty game lets you space out and push your worries away. You can click on the Space Bar and gain space bucks to spend on your space core's new space spunk. This novel interaction will be both relaxing and calming but be careful. If you gain too many space bucks too fast, you will be arrested by the space cops and put in space jail for being in space. Happy spacing out!
